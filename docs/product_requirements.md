# Event Timeline Product Requirements

## Overview

Event Timeline is a web-based application designed to help engineers efficiently manage and analyze system events during incident response. The tool enables users to curate raw event streams, build chronological timelines, annotate events with contextual information, and export clean documentation for team communication.

## Problem Statement

Engineers managing production incidents face information overload from multiple event sources including deployments, metric anomalies, and log errors. Manual curation of these events is time-consuming, error-prone, and delays root cause analysis. There's a need for a streamlined tool that enables rapid event triage, timeline construction, and documentation generation.

## Core Features

### 1. Event Stream Management
- Display a comprehensive list of raw events from various sources
- Support multiple event types: Deployments, Metric Anomalies, and Log Anomalies
- Enable efficient scrolling and searching through large event volumes
- Show essential event metadata (type, timestamp, description, user/metric)

### 2. Timeline Construction
- Drag-and-drop interface for selecting relevant events
- Automatic chronological ordering of selected events
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Ability to remove events from the timeline

### 3. Event Annotation
- Detailed view of selected timeline events
- Editable note fields for adding context and analysis
- Persistent storage of annotations
- Easy navigation between timeline events

### 4. Timeline Visualization
- Clear visual representation of temporal relationships
- Dynamic scaling to highlight time gaps between events
- Visual differentiation between clustered and isolated events
- Scannable interface for quick pattern recognition

### 5. Documentation Export
- Automatic generation of formatted Markdown documentation
- Include timestamps, event descriptions, and annotations
- One-click clipboard copy functionality
- Professional formatting suitable for team communication platforms

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Modern CSS solution (Tailwind CSS optional)
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
- **Build Tool**: Modern bundler (Vite/Webpack)
- **Testing**: Jest or Vitest for unit tests

### Development Standards
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript usage with no `any` types
- **Code Organization**: Clear separation of UI components and business logic
- **Performance**: Initial load time under 150ms
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Architecture Guidelines
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements
- Custom hooks for encapsulating side effects
- Single source of truth for application state
- Modular file structure with files under 120 lines
- Clear naming conventions reflecting component purpose

## User Experience Requirements

### Performance
- Smooth drag-and-drop interactions without lag
- Responsive design supporting 1024-1440px viewports
- Efficient rendering for datasets of varying sizes
- Graceful handling of empty and loading states

### Interaction Design
- Clear visual feedback for all user actions
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators for accessibility
- Helpful tooltips and contextual guidance
- Smooth animations respecting motion preferences

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for data parsing errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Recovery mechanisms for failed operations
- Console-free production builds

## Scalability Considerations

### Data Volume
- Efficient rendering for event lists exceeding 50 items
- Virtualization for large datasets
- Search optimization for quick filtering
- Memory-efficient state management

### Feature Extensibility
- Modular architecture supporting new event types
- Pluggable export formats
- Extensible annotation capabilities
- Theme system for visual customization

## Future Enhancements

### Persistence and Sharing
- Deep-linking to specific timeline configurations
- Local storage for work-in-progress timelines
- Timeline templates for common scenarios

### User Preferences
- Dark mode toggle
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Configurable time formats
- Personal annotation templates

### Advanced Features
- Multi-event selection with keyboard modifiers
- Timeline comparison views
- Event correlation suggestions
- Export format customization

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Comprehensive type definitions
- Self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Consistent code formatting
- Modular component design
- Unit tests for critical business logic

### Documentation
- Clear README with setup instructions
- Architecture decision records
- Component usage examples
- Development workflow documentation

### Deployment
- Single command installation: `npm install`
- Single command development server: `npm run start`
- Production-ready build process
- Environment-agnostic configuration

## Success Metrics

- Time to construct a timeline from raw events
- User satisfaction with drag-and-drop interface
- Export quality and usability in team communications
- Application performance under various data loads
- Accessibility compliance scores

## Constraints and Assumptions

- Client-side only implementation (no backend required)
- Event data provided in JSON format
- Modern browser environment
- Desktop-first design with responsive considerations
- English language interface
